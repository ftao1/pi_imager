## Quick bash script to write Pi OS bookworm to SD Card with customisations.

I wanted a quicker way to write Pi images to SD Card that has customisations I wanted ie console support.
The official Imager already has a lot of customisation, but lacks console enablement and I didn't want to
keep manually adding it after an image burn.

The script is self-explanatory and prompts you for values such as user, password, wifi details etc.
